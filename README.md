RunAway Plugin

This plugin enhances enemy escape behavior in RPG Maker by implementing a more sophisticated escape algorithm. The plugin introduces a Pathfinder class that utilizes the A* algorithm to calculate an optimal escape path for enemies to flee from the player character. The algorithm considers both the distance to the target player and the presence of obstacles on the map, ensuring that enemies choose the safest route possible to avoid collisions. By incorporating dynamic pathfinding calculations, the plugin elevates the AI capability of enemies, making their escape maneuvers more strategic and challenging for players.
